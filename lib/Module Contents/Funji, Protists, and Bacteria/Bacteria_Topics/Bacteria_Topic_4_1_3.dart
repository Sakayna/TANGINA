      There are thousands of species of bacteria on Earth. At this present time, only a few species have been studied and identified by scientists.

      Bacteria reproduce both asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction methods include binary fission, budding, and spore-formation, which are fast and simple. However, these produce clones that lack genetic diversity.
      Sexual reproduction involves genetic recombination, introducing new traits for survival in challenging environments.
